<summary><strong>Kitchen Recipe Management System</strong></summary>

This kitchen recipe management system is built using Node.js and Express. It follows a structure where CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are handled within routes without using controllers. This simplifies the architecture, with routes managing data manipulation, models for interacting with the database, and authentication/validation integrated into the routes. The system also includes testing and deployment procedures to ensure functionality in different environments.
